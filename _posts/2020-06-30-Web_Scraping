## Project Introduction
This is a web scraping process I used to help my company automate the trading data collection process and build a database. I used Selenium and BeautifulSoups to scrap the data from the website and then save the data as a dataframe

## Project Code
You can see the full process in the notebook with this [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/cinnabar723/Project-Library/blob/master/InsiderTrading.ipynb)
