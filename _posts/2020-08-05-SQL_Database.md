# Project Introduction
For this group project, our group designed a database for NYC Department of Buildings to store the construction job application data. We first performed the normalization process to model the data, and we designed 15 table based on exploration of the data. I was responsible for the ETL process and load the data into our database with Python. 

# Project Code
